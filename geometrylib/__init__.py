"""Routines for working with triangles.

The modules inside of this package are picked with useful features for the programmer who needs to support triangles:

``shape``
  This module provides a full-fledged Triangle object that can be instantiated and then asked to provide all sorts of information about its properties.
``utils``
  For the programmer in a hurry, this module offers quick functions that take as arguments the three side lengths of a triangle, and performs a quick conputation without the programmer having to make the extra step of creating an object
